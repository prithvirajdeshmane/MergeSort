# MergeSort
This is a recursive solution to the MergeSort algorithm. A provided input arrayList is recursively split in halves until the individual splits are either 1 or 2 elements long. These individual splits are then sorted. The sorted splits are then recursively merged until the original arrayList is fully sorted.
